# Embedding-Watermarks-into-Deep-Neural-Networks
This repository presents a novel approach to protecting intellectual property (IP) in deep neural networks (DNNs) by embedding watermarks directly into their parameters. Our work addresses the critical need for safeguarding shared DNN models while fostering collaboration and advancement in the field.
